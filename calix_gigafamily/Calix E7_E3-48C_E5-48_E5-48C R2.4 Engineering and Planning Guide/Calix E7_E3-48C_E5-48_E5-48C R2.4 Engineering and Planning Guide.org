- TR-069 and Consumer Connect Auto Configuration Server
 - The TR-069 client can be configured to run in the following management modes:
  - In-band runs on an existing WAN interface. Typically, the path to the ACS server utilizes an existing RG service, such as Gateway Service: 1 (HSI).
  - Out-of-band runs on its own WAN interface. An independent VLAN outside of the service VLANs is provisioned on HGW ONTs to facilitate communication to the ACS service.
