a service provider can apply a common, pre-defined RG configuration over multiple GigaFamily units using Consumer Connect Plus.
it has the ability to either manually upload RG configuration profiles directly to the RSG on a per subscriber basis, or apply a common RG configuration profile to all GigaCenter units deployed in a network based on OUI or other device attributes that comprise a CPE group.

RG configuration using ACS only over-writes the service defined attributes of the GigaFamily device database during the upload process.

configuration file can be created and uploaded to the GigaCenter, whether operating in Native or External mode.

***** External mode: transfer the configuration file to the GigaCenter via OMCI.
***** Native mode: using Consumer Connect Plus.

***** Note: From a best practices perspective, Calix recommends using Native Mode via Consumer Connect Plus.
***** Note: If you have uploaded the configuration file via OMCI (External Mode), you cannot upload a second configuration file via Consumer CONNECT PlusConsumer Connect Plus.

***** TR-069 and Consumer Connect Auto Configuration Server
****** The TR-069 client can be configured to run in the following management modes:
******* In-band runs on an existing WAN interface. Typically, the path to the ACS server utilizes an existing RG service, such as Gateway Service: 1 (HSI).
******* Out-of-band runs on its own WAN interface. An independent VLAN outside of the service VLANs is provisioned on HGW ONTs to facilitate communication to the ACS service.
